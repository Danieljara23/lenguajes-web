# Cards List

In this little workshop we'll try to recreate a simple cards layout similar to the one below:

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
  `git clone https://github.com/Danieljara23/lenguajes-web.git`

2. Keep in mind
  - The final layout should contain at least 6 cards
  - You should upload your final work to github pages
